# Microeconomic Agents

**Microeconomic Agents Trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on Microeconomic Simulators**

## Overview

**Micro Agents** is a project focused on training agents using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) within microeconomic simulators. The goal is to explore and model the behavior of economic agents in complex environments, simulating various microeconomic factors, such as production, consumption, and market dynamics.

## Features

- **Custom Microeconomic Simulators**: Simulates different microeconomic environments with adjustable parameters.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Agents are trained using DRL techniques to optimize their decision-making in a microeconomic context.
- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Investigate how agents behave under varying economic scenarios, allowing for the study of emergent market behavior.
- **Scalability**: The framework can be expanded to include multiple agents, competitors, and dynamic environments.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/EduardoGarrido90/micro_agents.git
   cd macro_agents
   \`\`\`
2. Install the required dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

## Usage

1. Configure the simulation environment and agent settings in the configuration file and bashes.
2. Run the microeconomic simulation with the bash file:
   \`\`\`bash
   ./execute_micro_agent.sh
   \`\`\`
3. Analyze the results and monitor agent performance through the output logs or visualizations.

## How It Works

1. **Simulators**: These provide an environment where agents can act as macroeconomic entities (producers, consumers, etc.). The simulators simulate real-world macroeconomic constraints and rewards.
   
2. **Agents**: Trained using DRL, the agents learn to optimize their economic decisions, such as production levels, consumption rates, and resource allocation, to maximize profits or other objectives.

3. **Training Process**: The agents interact with the environment, gather data, and improve their policies based on reward feedback.
